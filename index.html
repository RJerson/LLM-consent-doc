<h2>Applying Large Language Models to Project Management: A Multi-Method Analysis of The Benefits and Limitations on the cutting-edge AI technology.</h2>

<p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully. Send us an email or reply if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.</p>

<h2>What is the purpose of the project?</h2>
<p>A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model that uses a neural network with billions of parameters to process and understand natural language by capturing the syntax and semantics of human language, as well as general knowledge and facts about the world. 
This allows it to perform tasks such as text generation, classification, and question answering. In the field of project management, characterized for having a combination of general knowledge and a dynamic nature, these tools have been demonstrated to be helpful for planning, communication, and learning, among many other applications. One example of this is the widely popular application ChatGPT based on the large language model GPT-3.5.
However, to this date, there is a lack of empirical research on the applications and impacts of LLMs for project management, which impedes their adoption and hinders the development of more efficient project management practices, especially from the latest and evolved models such as GPT-4, that have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the technology’s capabilities and alignment. Thus, this project’s purpose is to narrow the knowledge gap on how LLMs can be leveraged to enhance project management by analysing the capabilities and identifying the potential challenges and limitations for successful integration.<p>
Finally, this research plans to be a dissertation for a master's degree in Engineering project management with the duration of 4 months. </p>
<h2>Why have I been chosen?</h2>
<p>You and other participants were chosen based on their expertise and experience in project management.  to gather opinions and experiences from a diverse group of individuals with varying levels of experience to assess the performance of Large Language Models in project management.
This study plans to survey a minimum of 50 people from different levels of experience in project management about their opinions and experiences. The study will be conducted in developed countries where project management is widely recognized and practiced.</p>

<h2>Do I have to take part?</h2>
<p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to approve a consent form. You can still withdraw at any time without the need to give a reason.</p>

<h2>What do I have to do? /  What will happen to me if I take part?</h2>
<p>You will be asked to complete a questionnaire once, with a duration of approximately 15 to 20 minutes. This questionnaire will cover first closed ended demographic and career related questions, secondly a survey about the participant’s usage of LLMs, thirdly an evaluation of accuracy and relevance for LLMs generated text of project management case studies’ solutions, and finally an open-ended questionnaire for completing any opinions and feedback.
Although the first, second and third section of the questionnaire is close ended. You will have the last part to discuss in-depth opinions and feedback about the technology, its solutions and the questionnaire itself. We expect comprehensive and reasonable answers, related to the technology and the field of project management with justifications of any expected opinion. The data will be analysed in a mixed approach both using quantitative and qualitative methods.
This is an online form and only the answers and text will be recorder. There is no financial incentive to complete the form, as this is dissertation research in order to achieve a master’s degree
As this is an online questionnaire about the usage of a particular technology in your field done anonymously, there is no expected health or lifestyle related consequences or restrictions in any way, shape or form. It is your decision to use this technology in your work or personal activities, and any unforeseeable consequences will not be the responsibility of this investigation.</p>

<h2>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h2>
<p>This technology generates text almost indistinguishable from those generated by humans, and some users have experienced discomfort, especially if they have never tried this before. Fortunately, the past year has seen a wide adoption and popularity of chatbots using large language models to process text. Therefore, you should be already familiar or adapted with this technology.
Any risks of disclosure of personal information, data breaches and privacy are minimized by complying with the confidentiality and anonymity of the research and taking multiple measure to guarantee the security of the data, as explained below. Finally, it is expected that no participant will expose any personal information in the open-ended questions and that you will take the questionnaire in a secure access to the web. </p>

<h2>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
<p>This paper aims to understand the capabilities and impacts of LLMs in project management. Therefore, by taking this survey, you will have the added value to understand better how this technology can be implemented in your daily work, and what are the main limitations in a structured way. Overall, it is hoped that this work will make a systematic understanding on the field’s part in this AI technology and how can be leveraged or limited to further improve the field. </p>
<h2>Use, dissemination and storage of research data</h2>

<p>The storage of the data will be done in line with the UK Data Protection Act 2018, who owns the data and that the use of the data is not for profit.</p>

<h2>What will happen to my personal information?</h2>

<p>In the research study, your personal information will be kept confidential and handled in accordance with applicable laws and ethical standards. Your personal information will only be accessible to the research team and will not be shared with anyone else without your consent.

In terms of anonymisation, the research team may assign codes to participants to protect their identities. This means that any data collected will be linked to a code rather than a name, and this code will be used to identify participants throughout the study.

The identifiable data collected from participants will be stored securely, and only the research team will have access to it. The data may be analysed and presented in research reports or publications, but any identifying information will be removed to protect participants' privacy.

Overall, the research team will take every precaution to protect your personal information and ensure confidentiality throughout the study.</p>


<h2>What will happen to the results of the research project?</h2>
<p>We will take measures to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of your information. Your responses will be kept strictly confidential, and only researchers involved in this study will have access to your data. All information collected during this study will be anonymized to protect your identity. We will remove any unexpected identifying information such as your name or contact information from the survey data before analysing.
We will make every effort to ensure that the results of this study may be disseminated through publication in academic journals or presentations at conferences.
